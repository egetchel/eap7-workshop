== Exercise 6 - High availability

=== What you will learn

Doing this exercise, participants will learn:

* the basis for setting up a cluster in JBoss EAP 7
* how to use JBoss EAP 7 as a load balancer.

In this exercise participants will also use Ansible to configure and roll-out an high available setup. However this lab will neither cover details about Ansible, nor require previous knowledge of Ansible.


=== Background information

==== Some vocabulary

Before we start, let go through some definitions related to clustering:

* *cluster* : set of server instances using a common communication channel to improve services availability by providing failover, fault-tolerance and scalability capabilities.

* *member or node* : server instance residing on one host and being part of one cluster.

There are three possible and supported clustering topologies:

* *horizontal scaling* : nodes running on different machines
* *vertical scaling* : nodes running on the same machine
* *mixed scaling* : combination of horizontal and vertical topologies

NOTE: Load-balancing and clustering are often mixed-up. Load-balancing is just about dispatching the load between different nodes. Clustering focuses on replicating state between nodes to guarantee failover.

'''


==== Subsystems

The following Red Hat JBoss EAP subsystems are involved in implementing highly available applications:

* *JGroups*
+
JGroups is a toolkit for the underlying communication between nodes.
Two main communication stacks are available in EAP: UDP (default) or TCP (no multicast).
+
JGroup 4 is bundled with EAP 7. It uses a separate dedicated logical interface for clustering ("private"). JGroup 4 uses of NIO.2 and Java 8 features (e.g. CompletableFuture).

* *infinispan*
+
Infinispan is used for data caching and object replication. In Red Hat JBoss  comes with 4 preconfigured caches (cluster, web, SFSB and hibernate).

* *modcluster*
+
mod_cluster is an httpd-based load balancer. Like mod_jk and mod_proxy, mod_cluster uses a communication channel to forward requests from httpd to one of a set of application server nodes.

* *singleton*
+
The singleton subsystem can be used for the deployment of applications as highly-available singletons.

* *Undertow*
+
Undertow is the new web server project integrated in EAP 7. It is a flexible and high performing Java web server providing NIO based blocking and non-blocking APIs.


==== Architecture

The following diagrams shows the lab setup, where JBoss EAP 7 is used as well as an application backend as a load-balancer:

=== Lab

WARNING: Please make sure that your JBoss Developer Studio is closed and all local JBoss are not running when you start this lab. A quick way for doing this is to run the following command:
`killall java`

Step 1 - Reviewing the Ansible setup::
+
We are soon gonna use Ansible to configure the cluster in JBoss EAP 7, but before we kick-off the setup, let's review how the setup looks like.
+
Ansible playbooks describes how different host are assigned different roles. Roles are broken down into different tasks.
+
Because of limitations in the lab environment we are not going to use different different host, but instead we are going to configure a cluster in your local host.
+
Let's first investigate the playbook.
+
[source,yaml]
----
    - hosts: localhost
      roles:
        - jboss-eap-7
----
+
So your localhost will be assigned the role of jboss-eap-7. Let's investigate that as well.
+
[source,yaml]
----
- name: Extract JBoss EAP 7  # <1>
  unarchive: src={{jboss_zip_path}} dest={{ ansible_user_dir }} owner={{jboss_user}} group={{jboss_group}} creates={{jboss_home}} copy=no

- name: Create admin user for JBoss # <2>
  shell: "export JBOSS_HOME={{ jboss_home }}; {{ jboss_home }}/bin/add-user.sh -u admin -p {{ jboss_admin_password }} -s"

- name: Add demo application # <3>
  copy: src={{item}} dest={{ ansible_user_dir }} owner={{ jboss_user }} group={{ jboss_group }} mode=644
  with_items:
    - clustering-demo.war

- name: Add CLI configuration script # <4>
  template: src=mod-cluster.cli dest={{ ansible_user_dir }} owner={{ jboss_user }} group={{ jboss_group }} mode=644

- name: Apply configuration # <5>
  shell: "export JBOSS_HOME={{ jboss_home }}; {{ jboss_home }}/bin/jboss-cli.sh --file={{ ansible_user_dir }}/mod-cluster.cli"

----
<1> In this step the JBoss EAP 7 zip will be extracted, but only if it doesn't previously exists
<2> This task will create an administrative user.
<3> Adding the a WAR application
<4> In this step we will use the template feature of Ansible to add a CLI script
<5> In this step we execute the CLI script.

Step 2 - Review the CLI script::
+
As we can see the Ansible script extracts and adds a administrative user, and then the configuration is a applied via an CLI script.
+
Let's look at the most important actions in the CLI script,
+
[source,bash]
----
embed-host-controller # <1>

/profile=ha:clone(to-profile=backend) # <2>
/profile=default:clone(to-profile=load-balancer) # <3>

/profile=backend/subsystem=modcluster/mod-cluster-config=configuration:write-attribute(name=advertise-security-key, value=mypassword) # <4>


/profile=load-balancer/subsystem=undertow/configuration=filter/mod-cluster=modcluster:add(management-socket-binding=http, advertise-socket-binding=modcluster, security-key=mypassword) # <5>

# Add a server group called backend-servers
/server-group=backend-servers:add(profile=backend, socket-binding-group=ha-sockets) # <6>

# Add server config for backend1 and backend2 using 100 and 200 binding port offset.
/host=master/server-config=backend1:add(group=backend-servers, socket-binding-port-offset=100) # <7>
/host=master/server-config=backend2:add(group=backend-servers, socket-binding-port-offset=200) # <7>


# Add a modcluster filter to the undertow server that will use mulitcast to connect to backend servers
/profile=load-balancer/subsystem=undertow/server=default-server/host=default-host/filter-ref=modcluster:add
/socket-binding-group=standard-sockets/socket-binding=modcluster:add(multicast-port=23364, multicast-address=224.0.1.105) # <8>

# Add the load-balancer server group
/server-group=load-balancer:add(profile=load-balancer, socket-binding-group=standard-sockets # <9>

# Add a load-balancer server to the load-balancer group
/host=master/server-config=load-balancer:add(group=load-balancer) # <10>

# Deploy the application to the servers in the backend-server group
deploy {{ ansible_user_dir }}/clustering-demo.war --server-groups=backend-servers # <11>

----
<1> Starts an embedded host controller so that we can configure the domain without actually starting it. For standalone the same command is `embed-server`. This feature is called Off-line CLI and is new in JBoss EAP 7
<2> This command will clone the `ha` profile and create a new profile called `backend`. The backend servers will be based on `ha` profile since they are going to form a clusters
<3> We also clone the `default` profile to a new profile called `load-balancer` since the load-balancer is not part of the cluster.
<4> Configure the modcluster subsystem in the backend profile to use an advertise security key set to "mypassword"
<5> Adding the mod-cluster filter to the undertow subsystem and configuring the advertise security key to "mypassword"
<6> Create a server group called `backend-servers`
<7> Create servers `backend1` and `backend2` in the `backend-servers` server group.
<8> Add a modcluster filter to the undertow server that will use multicast to connect to backend servers
<9> Add the load-balancer server group
<10> Add a load-balancer server to the load-balancer group
<11> Deploy an application to the backend servers.

Step 3 - Execute the Ansible playbook::
To run the ansible playbook open a terminal window and go to the exercise directory and run the `ansible-playbook` command.
+
[source,bash]
----
$ cd exercises/projects/06_high-availability
$ ansible-playbook playbook.yml
----

Step 4 - Start the JBoss EAP 7 cluster::
To start the cluster is as simple as starting the standalone version, since Ansible helped us configure everything all we need to do is to go to the `$JBOSS_HOME/bin` and execute `domain.sh` instead of `standalone.sh`
+
[source,bash]
----
$ cd ~/jboss-eap-7.0/bin
$ sh domain.sh
----

Step 4 - Verify the application in a browser::
To verify the application open the following url in firefox http://localhost:8080/clustering-demo/index.jsp
+
image::images/06_01_clustering-demo.png["",400]
+
Reload the page a couple of times and notices that the number of request increases, but that the backend-server is always the same. This is because our application is using sessions and mod_cluster is using session affinity (or sticky session).

Step 5 - High availability::

To test the high availability we can suspend the server that our session is connected to. In this step we will use backend-server1, but please you should use the same server that where listed in Step 4.
+
To suspend the server follow the below steps
+
. Open another tab to the admin console (http://localhost:9990)
. Login with username `admin` and password `admin-123`
. Click on `Runtime` tab
. Browse Domain by `Server Groups` -> `backend-servers` -> `backend1`
. Select `Suspend` from the drop down menu next to `backend1`
+
image::images/06_02_suspend_backend1.png["",600]
+
. Click on `Suspend Server`
+
image::images/06_03_suspend_server.png["",400]
. Reload the other firefox tab with the clustering-demo application
+
If everything worked correctly the backend server should now change and the counter should continue from and not restart.

Step 6 - Performance testing::
Now that we have seen how to setup JBoss EAP 7 for clustering and load balancing let's see if we can find the optimal number of servers for this hosts. For this we are going to use a performance tool from Apache HTTPD tools called `ab`.
+
Before we do that we probably want to resume the server that we suspended in step 5. Then we can open a terminal window and run the following command in it.
+
[source,bash]
----
$ curl -s http://localhost:8080/clustering-demo/?[1-10]
----
+
The output should look something like below and include responses from both backend1 and backend2
+
[source,bash]
----
Server backend2
Server backend1
Server backend2
Server backend1
Server backend2
Server backend1
Server backend2
Server backend1
Server backend2
Server backend1
----
+
Then we are ready to start the simple performance test. Execute the following command to put some load onto the server.
+
[source,bash]
----
$ ab -n 10000 -c 100 -k http://localhost:8080/clustering-demo
----
+
This command uses 100 clients to post 100 request with a total of 10 000 request. When the test is done it's going to print a report that looks something like the one below.
+
[source,bash]
